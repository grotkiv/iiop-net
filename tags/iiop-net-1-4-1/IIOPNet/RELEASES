new features:

- initial support for IDL local interfaces
- IDLPreprocessor: now supports #ifdef, #else.

Version 1.4.0 (26 August 2003)
------------------------------

new features:

- corbaloc:iiop support -> improved nameservice access for JBoss
- JBoss 3.2.1 EJB demo added
- custom mapping support: possible to specify a different mapping, e.g. for Collections:
  CLS ArrayList directly mapped to java ArrayList and vice versa. (see MappingPlugin Integration tests)
- automation of integration / unit tests
- mapping document added


new tests:

- more integration tests, e.g. WLS6.1 test


changes:

- loading of assemblies for serialisation / deserialisation improved:
  now considers RelativeSearchPath of Appdomain
- chunked encoded value types deserialisation problems corrected
- improved mapping of type/method-names
- CLS server objects; support for is_a CORBA standard methods reestablished

  Special names (name mapping exceptions) are now better supported.
- .NET server states now in the IOR sent to clients in every case, that remote object supports GIOP 1.2.
- overloaded CLS methods are now handled corretly

new features:

- added initial support for LocateRequest/LocateReply GIOP messages
- added a -r option to IDL to CLS compiler for using types from assembly instead of generating them.

new tests:
