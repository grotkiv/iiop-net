Known Problems
--------------

1. Using .NET Framework 1.1

When using the .NET Framework 1.1, you must configure NUnit 2.0 to use the same Framework version. To do so,
add the line
  <startup> 
    <supportedRuntime version="v1.1.4322" /> 
  </startup> 
in %NUNTIV2_HOME%/bin/nunit-gui.exe.config and %NUNTIV2_HOME%/bin/nunit-console.exe.config
