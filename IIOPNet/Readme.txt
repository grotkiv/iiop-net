IIOP.NET (http://iiop-net.sourceforge.net/)
-------------------------------------------

IIOP.NET allows a seamless interoperation between .NET, 
CORBA and J2EE distributed objects. This is done by 
incorporating CORBA/IIOP support into .NET, leveraging 
the remoting framework.


IIOP.NET is released under the LGPL license. 

IIOP.NET is provided and supported by ELCA Informatique SA
(http://www.elca.ch/)


OVERVIEW
--------

This package contains:

IIOP.NET:
	a channel for the .NET framework, which performs
	serialization and deserialization of CLS objects
	for the CORBA protocol
CLSToIDLGenerator:
	a tool for generating the OMG IDL definition for a
	CLS type; takes the assembly as parameter
IDLToCLSCompiler:
	a tool for generating CLS metadata for OMG IDL
	definitions.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

IIOP.NET requires Microsoft's .NET Framework 1.0 and a
a C# compiler.
The IDLToCLSCompiler requires Microsoft's J# redistributable
package.


INSTALLATION
------------

To compile the tutorials, you must copy the files "ir.idl" and "orb.idl"
in the ./IDL directory. You will find these two files as part of your
Java SDK in the %JAVAHOME%\lib directory.


BUILDING IIOP.NET
-----------------

To build IIOP.NET use
	nmake
or
	nmake build

This command will recursively build the IIOPChannel,
the CLSToIDLGenerator and the IDLToCLSCompiler.

To remove the binaries generated by the build, use
