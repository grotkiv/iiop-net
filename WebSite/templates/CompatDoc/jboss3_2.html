This howto contains information for IIOP.NET 1.2.3 or newer.

<b>Accessing the name service</b> <BR> <BR>

The JBoss nameservice can be accessed from a .NET client with the following code:

<pre>
    NamingContext nameService = (NamingContext)RemotingServices.Connect(typeof(NamingContext), nameserviceIOR);
</pre> <p/>

The nameserviceIOR is the IOR printed by JBoss at startup in a line [CorbaNamingService] Naming: [IOR: -- a hex string --].
The IOR consists of IOR: and the long hex string. <BR>
We will try to find a better way for accessing the nameservice in the near future.
<BR> <BR>
Hint: <BR>
The RemotingServices class can be found in System.Runtime.Remoting.

<p/>
<b>Using an EJB</b> <BR> <BR>

The ejb home interface is accessed using the name service in the following way:


<pre>
    NameComponent[] name = new NameComponent[] { new NameComponent("MyHome", "") };
    // get the reference to the adder-home
    MyEjbHome myHomeIf = (MyEjbHome)nameService.resolve(name);
</pre> <p/>

The ejb can now be created using this home interface (standard ejb pattern):

<pre>
    MyEjb myBean = myHomeIf.create();
</pre> <p/>

<p/>
<b>Known problems</b> <BR> <BR>
<UL>
<LI>The jndi-name (see jboss.xml) for the ejb may not contain more than one component at the moment, i.e. can't contain a /.</LI>
</UL>
